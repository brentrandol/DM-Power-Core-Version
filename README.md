# DM-Power
DM-Power is powerful quick command line interface tool for DM's running 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. It is made entirely on C++. It uses data from the D&D 5e _Player's Handbook_ and _Dungeon Master Guide_. It uses the core rules that are in the core books. There is no homebrew here. 

The DM-Power program does not teach you the game. You will need the books. I recommend buying them from Amazon, a local game store, or any official retailer that supports Hasbro and WotC.
