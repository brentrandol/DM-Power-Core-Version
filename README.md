# DM-Power
DM-Power (originally called _its-dm-magic_) is a command line tool for DMs running 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. It is made to aid in on the fly dming, planning, random item generation, and NPC or PC creation. It uses data from the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master Guide. All rights reserved natually as I don't own the content of these books. What it doesn't do: teach you the game. You should have the books and be able to reference the abilites, rules, items, spells, etc.
