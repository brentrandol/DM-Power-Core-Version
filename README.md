# DM-Power
DM-Power is powerful quick command line interface tool for DM's running 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. It is made entirely on C++. It uses data from the D&D 5e Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master Guide. It uses the core rules that are in the core books. There is no homebrew here. 

It does not teach you the game. You will need the books. I recommend buying them from Amazon or any official retailer that supports Hasbro and WotC.
