# DM-Power-Core-Version
A lightweight yet powerful command line interface tool for DM's running 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. It is made entirely on C++.  
It uses data from the D&D 5e _Player's Handbook_, _Dungeon Master Guide_, & _Sword Coast Adventurer's guide_.  
This small program does not teach you the game. You will need the books. I recommend buying them from Amazon, a local game store, or any official retailer that supports Hasbro and WotC.   
My overall goal is to make this program simple enough that it does not require a how-to use document once you get it running.  
### Featuring: *DM-Power*  
_It's DM Magic!_  

1. Characters: Get going quick with a streamlined character creation process for Players or Non-Players.
    * **All** Classes and Paths, Races, Levels, Feats, Skills, Proficiencies, Backgrounds, and Stats
        * Has extra class archetypes & backgrounds from the _Sword Coast Adventures Guide_ (SCAG) & _DMG_
        * Based on the logic from the PHB character creation
    * Powerful after creation character **editor**
        * _Level Up_ tool that sticks to the charts and prompts everything you need.

        * Unlimited different save files.
        * Made to be one save file per campaign, but yrequireour style may vary.
    * What the character maker doesn't do (yet)
        * Items - might hint at what some of your items are but you have to come up with your equipment on your own
        * Some non-artisan tools and trades from the clprofileasses have not been added yet (game sets and vehicles mainly)
        * Spells - tells you how many cantrips, slots, and known spells but you still have to pick your spells
        
2. Magic Item Generator: Figure out treasure and rewards in seconds!
    * Reward rolling charts from the DMG
        * Auto roll or enter your own result.
        * Magic Items

        * Coins, Gems, Valuable Art
        * Scroll Generator - just tell it what level and it gives you a scroll
        
3. Party Experience Calculator - add up as many cr's as you want and then split it with the party. Simple yet effective.

4. Name Generator: 7732 names from Kismet's list randomized! Pick this option and it gives you a random name.

#### This is the Master Version.
_Based on the 5e books._

* Stick with this version to stick with the official 5e books.
* This will be actively updated and added to. There will be even more tools and features in the future.
* The Load/Save logic is subject to change in major updates to the character generator, so have your character written down or something for now.

#### How-to run:

1. Have a C++ compiler. Follow online guides to get one if necessary.
2. Use Terminal and type 'make' while in this file directory. Email me if you have trouble.
3. Type ./dmpower in terminal to run.

#### HALP!

* If you run into a problem or something unclear - please open an issue ticket.
* Anything you would like to see added to this program - open a issue ticket with the title FEATURE: in front of the issue name. 

#### Long-Standing To-do

* Be aware that is my first project of magnitude that others may actually want to use - help me learn if you see something that could be done better.
* As I learn more about coding in general, I sometimes realize that I did things wrong from a professional standpoint (public variables that should be private, etc). So eventually I'll get around to correcting that stuff. For now it just works how it is.

* Why? I am a D&D enthusiast and a C++ programmer and needed a project for when I'm not doing classes. I enjoy DMing and wanted a program that did the book work for me so I wouldn't have to book dive in the middle of sessions and hence have faster, more action packed games. I currently run a season based campaign that is streamed on [Twitch - Watchers of Faerun](https://twitch.tv/watchersoffaerun)
