* Why? I am a D&D enthusiast and a C++ programmer and needed a project for when I'm not doing classes. I enjoy DMing and wanted a program that did the book work for me so I wouldn't have to book dive in the middle of sessions and hence have faster, more action packed games. I currently run a season based campaign that is streamed on [Twitch - Watchers of Faerun](https://twitch.tv/watchersoffaerun)
