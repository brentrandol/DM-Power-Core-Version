#### How-to compile and run:

1. You will need a c++ compiler. I usually use the latest GNU version but this should work with about any.
2. Use '_qmake dmpower.pro_' to build a makefile, then do '_make_' in terminal. Or use the makefile I've already generated by just typing 'make' in the directory. Or the last option, just type '_g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o dmpower_' in terminal.
3. Type '_./dmpower_' in terminal while in the build directory after compiling to run the program.

* Why? I am a D&D enthusiast and a C++ programmer and needed a project for when I'm not doing classes. I enjoy DMing and wanted a program that did the book work for me so I wouldn't have to book dive in the middle of sessions and hence have faster, more action packed games. I currently run a season based campaign that is streamed on [Twitch - Watchers of Faerun](https://twitch.tv/watchersoffaerun)
