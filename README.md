# DM-Power-Core-Version
A lightweight yet powerful command line interface tool for DM's running 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. It is made entirely on C++. It uses data from the D&D 5e _Player's Handbook_ and _Dungeon Master Guide_. It uses the core rules that are in the core books and WoTC/Hasbro owns all the data in these charts, I've merely just put it together in my own way that was most useful to me.

This small program does not teach you the game. You will need the books. I recommend buying them from Amazon, a local game store, or any official retailer that supports Hasbro and WotC. 

My overall goal is to make this program simple enough that it does not require a how-to use document once you get it running.

* Why? I am a D&D enthusiast and a C++ programmer and needed a project for when I'm not doing classes. I enjoy DMing and wanted a program that did the book work for me so I wouldn't have to book dive in the middle of sessions and hence have faster, more action packed games. I currently run a season based campaign that is streamed on [Twitch - Watchers of Faerun](https://twitch.tv/watchersoffaerun)
* Shoutout to **Wizards of the Coast**. WotC, if you read this, please consider reaching out to me and lets work together to make D&D a more enjoyable, managable game from the DM's perspective.
